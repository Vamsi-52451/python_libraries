## Topics Covered

### 1. Pip - Installing Packages
- **What it is**: Pythonâ€™s package manager for installing and managing third-party libraries.  
- **Where to apply**: Installing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, FastAPI.  
- **Advantages**: Easy dependency management, quick installation, and access to PyPI.

---

### 2. Virtual Environments (venv/conda setup)
- **What it is**: Isolated environments for different Python projects.  
- **Where to apply**: Multiple projects with unique dependencies.  
- **Advantages**: Prevents conflicts, ensures reproducibility, keeps environments clean.

---

### 3. NumPy
- **What it is**: Library for numerical computations with arrays and matrices.  
- **Where to apply**: Data analysis, linear algebra, image processing, ML.  
- **Advantages**: Fast operations, handles large datasets efficiently, supports broadcasting.

---

### 4. Pandas
- **What it is**: Data analysis library using DataFrames.  
- **Where to apply**: Data cleaning, transformation, financial analysis, ML preprocessing.  
- **Advantages**: Easy tabular data handling, missing data management, integrates with NumPy and visualization libraries.

---

### 5. Matplotlib
- **What it is**: Data visualization library.  
- **Where to apply**: Graphs, plots, charts for data analysis and reporting.  
- **Advantages**: Highly customizable, many plot types, integrates with Pandas/NumPy.

---

### 6. Data Preprocessing
- **What it is**: Cleaning and transforming raw data before analysis.  
- **Where to apply**: Machine learning pipelines, analytics, reporting.  
- **Advantages**: Improves data quality, handles missing values, ensures accurate modeling.

---

### 7. HTTP Basics (GET, POST, Status Codes)
- **What it is**: Foundation of web communication.  
  - **GET**: Retrieve data.  
  - **POST**: Send data.  
  - **Status Codes**: Indicate request results (200 = OK, 404 = Not Found, 500 = Server Error).  
- **Where to apply**: APIs, web applications, client-server communication.  
- **Advantages**: Standardized, widely used protocol across web systems.

---

### 8. FastAPI Fundamentals
- **What it is**: A modern, high-performance Python web framework for APIs.  
- **Where to apply**: REST APIs, backend services, microservices.  
- **Advantages**: Fast, async support, automatic docs (Swagger UI), type-safe.

---

### 9. Pydantic
- **What it is**: Library for data validation and parsing.  
- **Where to apply**: Validating inputs, serializing/deserializing data in APIs.  
- **Advantages**: Type enforcement, reliability, seamless with FastAPI.

---

### 10. Async Programming (async/await basics)
- **What it is**: Writing concurrent, non-blocking code using async/await.  
- **Where to apply**: Web servers, API calls, I/O-bound tasks, real-time apps.  
- **Advantages**: Improved performance, reduced blocking, better scalability.
